## Setup

Add my maven repo to you module's build.gradle repositories

```groovy
maven {
  url 'https://github.com/eneim/FloppyVideoView/raw/master/maven-repo'
}
```

Then add ```flvv``` to that module's dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
  // other dependencies
  
  // FloppyVideoView v1.1.0
  compile 'im.ene.lab:flvv:1.1.0'
}
```
